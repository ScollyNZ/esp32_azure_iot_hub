# Environment Set Up

Starting a new project and its been too long so can't remember how to set my environment up, so here goes.

1. Review PlatformIO plugin docs for how to work with ESP32
2. Use PIO home to create new project for ESP32, resulting in the esp32-Azure-AIO folder
3. USB port not showing up, following [this](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/linux-setup.html)
4. restarted OS, still nothing
5. Moved the device, LED lit up. Appears to be a dodgy cable
