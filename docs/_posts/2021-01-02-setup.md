# Environment Set Up

Starting a new project and its been too long so can't remember how to set my environment up, so here goes.

1. Review PlatformIO plugin docs for how to work with ESP32
2. Use PIO home to create new project for ESP32, resulting in the esp32-Azure-AIO folder
3. USB port not showing up, following [this](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/linux-setup.html)
4. restarted OS, still nothing
5. Moved the device, LED lit up. Appears to be a dodgy cable

## Starting Development - again

1. Setup WiFi to look for how WiFi, then mobile WiFi
1. reading source code of library it appears that SDA is port 25 and SCL is port 26, by default
1. ADS1115 found
   Scanning (SDA : SCL) - GPIO25 : GPIO26 - I2C device found at address 0x48  !
1. Got the basics working, taking readings from a ADS1115 from a voltage divider and a current shunt
1. Added AzureIOTHub library to project
2. Created IOT hub in Azure and created 1 device "esp1". Connection string is "HostName=srstraininghub.azure-devices.net;DeviceId=esp1;SharedAccessKey=qJdsnbL1AY460d9x07zGLzR2PhmizH9pH0LNc2jrFms="
